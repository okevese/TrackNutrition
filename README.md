## TrackNutrition

----
### Motivation

This project was created because I wanted a way to track my daily nutrient intake and also be alerted of how well I was doing compared to the recommended daily quantities. My learning [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-2.2) along the way is an intended side effect :).

## Tools
The project uses [EF Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/), an object relational mapper, to interact with an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database. Other dependencies provided as Nuget packages.
